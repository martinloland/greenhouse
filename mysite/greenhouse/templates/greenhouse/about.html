                        I have have always been fascinated by home automation and this project is an investigation of what could be possible using a raspberry pi, some basic electronics and the magic of python.

                        <li>Django web framework</li>
                        <li>Built in SQLite database</li>
                        <li>Raspberry pi zero with built in WiFi</li>

                        <li>nginx HTTP server</li>
                        <li>uWSGI for web server gateway interface</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        When the raspberry pi boots it will automatically start two processes.
                        One starts the server and the other is a python scripts that read sensor values, captures images and control the lights and water pump.
                        Both processes communicate with a local database file to write sensor values, read settings etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The current version is in debug mode, this means that the video feed and sensor readings are not taken from an actual camera or sensor.
                    </p>
